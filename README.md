# CPPND: Capstone Mason Game

A mason has to build a wall by "shooting" flying blocks, which come to build a brick layer. This layer dissapears as soon as it is "full"
and a new randomly incomplete layer shows up to keep the mason busy. Every complete layer increases the score.

You can move the mason laterally using the numPad:
4 and 6 respectively for left and right.
When pressing 8 a block will fly and go to the
Layer.

NOTE: if the mason seems not to move try
locking/unlocking the NumPad by pressing
the NmLk key on the keyboard.

Among the concepts applied are:
The use of locks/mutex
- For protecting the vector indicating the 
Presence of blocks in the layer. 
- Using threads for moving the mason and
Propeling the flying block
- inheritance
- polymorphy
- memory management
