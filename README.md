# CPPND: Capstone Mason Game

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25869441/182407220-379487c5-1147-426b-8f17-bfd09aef7023.png)


A mason has a build a wall by "shooting" flying blocks, which come to build a brick layer. This layer dissapears as soon as it is "full"
and a new randomly incomplete layer shows up to keep the mason busy. Every complete layer increases the score.


You can move the mason laterally using the numPad:
4 and 6 respectively for left and right.
When pressing 8 a block will fly and go to the
Layer.
